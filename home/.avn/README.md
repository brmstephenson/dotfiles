Automatic Version Switching for Node.js

## Install

``` bash
npm install -g avn avn-nvm avn-n
avn setup
```

Now when you `cd` into a directory with a `.node-version` file, `avn` will
automatically detect the change and use your installed version manager to
switch to that version of node.


## Plugins

`avn` supports both [`nvm`][nvm] and [`n`][n] through [`avn-nvm`][avn-nvm] and
[`avn-n`][avn-n].

We don't recommend using both tools to manage your versions of node, but feel
free to install both plugins. They won't conflict with each other.


## Todo List

 * Support switching back to the previous version of node that you were using
   when you leave a directory.

Pull requests are welcome!


## Troubleshooting

If you're having a problem, please `cd` to the directory where your
`.node-version` file is stored and run (note the underscore prefix):

```bash
_avn explain -v .
```

Create an [issue][issues] and include the output.

Also note that the `avn setup` command will only work with the version of node
with which you installed it. If you install and then switch your node version,
you'll get an error that `avn` can't be found. This is okay, but if you need to
run the setup command again, simply `npm install -g avn` to get a new copy for
your current node version.
